                            <span className="about-dashstart-txt">Ouro helps drive the diversion of food waste from landfills to initiatives that require food waste as a raw material. This will decrease the damages to our environment as a result of  the release of greenhouse gases, produced as food waste decomposes in landfills.</span>
